# Italian Wikipedia Deletion Bot

This software is an Italian Wikipedia bot. It keeps updated the public deletion logs of Italian Wikipedia pages.

## History of the project

The script was originally developed by Mauro762 (aka MauroBot) in 2013 using JavaScript and previously developed in Python {{Citation needed}}.

## Installation

	sudo apt install git php-cli
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/valerio-bozzolan/ItalianWikipediaDeletionBot

## Configuration

1. Open the file [`config-example.php`](config-example.php) with a text editor
2. Fill your bot credentials
3. Save-as `config.php`

## Usage

Run on today:

    ./bot.php

Run on the latest 10 days from today:

    ./bot.php --days=10

Run on a specific date (year-month-day):

    ./bot.php --from=2018-03-13

Run on a specific date and for 10 days before it:

	./bot.php --days=10 --from=2018-03-13

Quit if someone was running the bot just `5` minutes ago (that is the default behaviour):

	./bot.php --minutes-ago=5

Ask before saving and enable verbose mode:

	./bot.php --ask --verbose

Help:

	./bot.php --help

## Update

To fetch the updates:

    git pull --recurse-submodules

## Hacking

Most of the behaviours — as the content of the categories, the pages, their edit summaries, etc. — can be changed simply hacking the content of the files from the [/templates](/templates) directory. Trust me, you are able to do it.

Start becoming familiar with their structure:

	<!-- START DOCUMENTATION -->
	This is the place for some documentation, expecially about "placeholders".
	<!-- START SPECIFIC EXAMPLE -->
	This is the place for a specific example
	<!-- START TEMPLATE -->
	This is the place for the most important part of this file.
	This part is what this template will generates.
	It uses stuff like "$1" or "%1%02d" as generic placeholders.

To be honest: everything above the `<!-- START TEMPLATE -->` line it's pure documentation sugar. It's written to help you. I've spent some minutes on them. Please RTFM. asd

A non-traumatic template example can be found [here](templates/CATEGORY_YEAR.content.tpl). It describes the generation of the yearly category.

## Framework

You may not want to know this: HTTP connections, MediaWiki APIs (including login and tokens etc.), and other stuff, are handled by the [boz-mw](https://github.com/valerio-bozzolan/boz-mw) framework.
